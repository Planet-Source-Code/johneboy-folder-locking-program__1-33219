### Description

I was working on this a while ago, and never finished it, but I have seen a couple of Folder locking program submitted, so I figured I would share my version. It works on the same principle as most, renaming to a special folders corresponding CLSID. It also adds a to the context menu, the option to lock. The only thing I haven't been able to figure out is, how to incorporate my own icon to the locked files. I did figure one way, by making my own special folder CSLID, but when I did this, if you right clicked on a locked file, you would see two opens and also explorer. the one open would open the folder normally. This time I am using my own CLSID as well, but its the same as the windows shortcut (lnkfile). Any feedback is appreciated.
